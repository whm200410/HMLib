# hmlib
c++ useful library used in all my private projects.
it contains several parts:
1) msg, there are two mechanism, message propagation and message signal/slot. it's perfectly fitable used in GUI/data seperated layer.
2) service worker, if you wanna a service than need to process a sequence of task, that's it.
3) utils.
